## TODO:
### Minor Changes
* allow/test multiple enemies in combat
* swap places when you move toward an ally
### Major Features
* combat animations
* pick up items from bodies
* level up/progression system
* chain levels/descend/boss levels


* **add lots more items/abilities/enemy types/classes/ai behaviors**


## Potential Classes:

**Idea**: 3 roles: DPS, Tank, Support. Each role has a magical and non magical variant class. Each class has two specializations/skill trees. Within each of these there are some abilities that can be levelled 1,2,3. They get a stat buff each time and do a little something extra at level three

**Another Idea:** Leveling up: Maybe kills grant some kind of essence to the party as a whole. You can choose to invest this to unlock abilities for any party member.

### Support:

#### Wizard (conjurer)

Ranged magical class focused on utility. Good at crowd control and altering the battlefield. Can also (as an alternate skill tree?) conjure ally familiars, but can't do much damage on his own.

**Ability Ideas:**
* Specialization: Utility
    * Vines: Magically damage an enemy (a little bit) and summon vines around them that slow movement through them for all characters based on spell level. At level three they damage you when you move though them or only slow opponents (?).
    * Teleport: Move an enemy or ally some number of spaces away depending on level.
    * Summon wall: put an temporary wall on (1>3>3) tiles. Walls can be attacked/destroyed by enemies. At level three, knock back characters standing where the walls are spawned
* Specialization: Conjuring
    * Familiar: Summon an allied creature to a tile. Stats/type of the creature depend on level.
    * Decoy: Summon a weak decoy that does no damage but taunts nearby enemies until it is destroyed
    * Raise dead?


#### Ranger/Rogue/monk?

Some non-magical mostly-melee support-oriented class. Can set traps, perform non-magical (melee-range) healing, maybe do assassinations/backstabs in an alternate skill tree


**Ability Ideas:**
* Specialization: Utility
    * Trap: Put a trap/tripwire on the ground that, if an enemy walks over it, immobilizes/paralyzes them for a turn them and does some damage
    * Minor melee-range heal?
    * ...
* Specialization: Damage
    * Assassinate: requires a melee weapon. does a ton of damage if the target is already at low health
    * ...


### Tank

#### Knight/Barbarian

Non-magical warrior. Takes a lot of damage and does a lot of physical melee damage.

**Ability Ideas:**
* Specialization: Tank
    * Taunt: force enemies to attack the knight next round
    * Defensive stance/shield/riposte: If an enemy attacks them before their next turn, prevent the damage and get a counter attack
    * Determination: for height energy cost, guarantee to not be brought below 1 health until next turn
* Specialization: Damage
    * Power attack: Costs extra energy and does extra damage
    * Some ability that does damage to themselves/makes them more vulnerable but does a ton of damage
    * ...

#### Paladin

Magical warrior. Good at healing




### DPS

#### Archer/ranger

A non-magical ranged damage-dealing unit. Any class can basic attack with a bow but the archer is extra good at it/has abilities that require/make use of a bow


#### Mage/Plague Doctor/Sorcerer

A magical damage dealer

* Specialization: AOE
    * Ignite: light the ground on fire
    * Lightning: Send out a lightning bolt that damages all enemies in a line
    * ??

* Specialization: Single target
    * Fireball: Send out a fireball that does a tone of damage to the first enemy it hits in a direction
    * Set enemy on fire/magically poison them (damage over time)
    * ??
